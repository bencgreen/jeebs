Libraries for use in .NET Core projects for rapid application development.

Please [view the wiki](https://github.com/bencgreen/jeebs/wiki) for information on how to use these libraries.

## History

I am definitely a backend developer at heart, although like everyone I have to write front-facing things sometimes!  However I am happiest when I'm writing code that makes frontend developer easier - and more beautiful.

The code in these libraries has been under active development and use for over a decade, powering all my own websites, and some for other people as well.

The most recent changes - v4.1, which is still in beta - come from a) rewriting the entire codebase to make use of C# 8's improvements to null handling, and b) a COVID lockdown project of learning to write in F#.  I thought for a while I might completely switch, but I decided I would prefer to bring some of the things I loved about F# into my C# - Jeebs 4.1 is the result.
